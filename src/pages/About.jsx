          <p>
            The rise of our cooperative organization is a history born from a
            collective dream, unwavering faith, and the purpose of social
            transformation. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, five
            ordinary citizens initiated this institution with an initial capital
            of Rs. 143,000, aiming to empower communities facing economic
            inequality and social insecurity. Today, this small seed has grown
            to serve over 2,600 members with the support of four dedicated
            employees.

            In this year, we secured membership in the National Co-operative

            system and opening collaboration opportunities with four prestigious
            district and central-level institutions. Under the Access Branding
            Program with NEFSCUN guidance, we prioritized members' needs,
            ensuring transparency, accountability, and modern technology
            integration.
